# SheepSuite
A suite of networking tools planned to be a free alternative to BurpSuite. 

I was frustrated using BurpSuite while learnin cyber-security via VulnHub (mostly because I couldn't use threading). 


Currently has LFI and fuzzing capabilities. More to be added later, including an updated README containing usage instructions.

Currently still in development.
